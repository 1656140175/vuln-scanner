## 🔧 Integration Points

### With Existing System
- Integrates with existing `vuln_scanner/core` architecture
- Extends `vuln_scanner/utils` with platform-aware functions
- Compatible with current configuration management
- Ready for integration with scanning components

### Usage Examples
```python
# Simple platform initialization
from vuln_scanner.utils import initialize_platform, is_windows, get_config_value

initialize_platform()
if is_windows():
    output_dir = get_config_value('output_dir')
    print(f"Windows output directory: {output_dir}")

# Advanced initialization
from vuln_scanner.platform import PlatformInitializer

initializer = PlatformInitializer({'memory_limit_mb': 8192})
result = await initializer.full_setup()
print(f"Setup successful: {result.success}")
```

## 📈 Next Steps & Integration
