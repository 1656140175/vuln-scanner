class MyScanEngine(ProgressTrackingMixin, BaseScanEngine):
    async def scan_target(self, target):
        async with self.progress_tracked_scan(scan_id, profile, target_info) as task_id:
            await self.update_scan_progress(scan_id, ScanPhase.DISCOVERY, 25.0)
            await self.complete_scan_phase(scan_id, ScanPhase.DISCOVERY)
```

### REST API Usage
```bash
# Complete REST API for external integrations
curl -X POST /api/v1/tasks -d '{"scan_id": "scan-123", "scan_profile": "comprehensive"}'
curl /api/v1/tasks/task-123/progress
curl -X POST /api/v1/tasks/task-123/pause
```

### WebSocket Streaming
```javascript
// Real-time progress updates
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/api/v1/ws?subscription=all');
ws.onmessage = (event) => updateProgressBar(JSON.parse(event.data));
```

### CLI Management
